Starter kit for budding product managers

This is meant to provide a quick guide to taking the first steps into product management - building up product fundamentals.

## Step 1: Basic Understanding

### Business Understanding

Products power/enable businesses. So first things first, lets understand how businesses work, and how functions within a business deliver their impact.

For starters - understanding and using some easy starter-kit frameworks doesnt hurt: 

- Business Model Canvas
- Porterâ€™s Five Forces
- PESTLE framework
- SWOT analysis

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ If possible - go beyond understanding the framework - understand why the frameworks are the way they are - why the frameworks ask you to look into specific aspects/components for analysis - why are they relevant?

</aside>

### Product Management

> First - lets understand how a product manager might think, when fulfilling their role to **********************************************************************************************************ship the right product, at the right time, to the right audience**********************************************************************************************************
> 

For a concise list of readings to start with - can refer to this personâ€™s review of the Stamford Product Management course - where he compiled the various pre-readings used in the course.

Other optional readings:

- Marty Caganâ€™s product-related books
- Momâ€™s Test

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Important thing to note here is that all these readings below are to provide you with different frameworks and tools that a product manager MAY or may not use in his/her role - depending on the situation

</aside>

### For Tech

> Ideally, you have tech/com science background - which will be more or less required for technically-compelx products/companies

This need is less stringent
> 

For the less-stringent type - whatâ€™s important is to have a fundamental understanding of how computer science and programming works.

Some pretty nice resources include:

- Codecademyâ€™s beginner courses
- Harvard EDXâ€™s com science course for beginners (online, think its free?)

Examples of key terms to know and understand how they fit into the larger picture:

1. Front-end
2. APIs
3. SDKs
4. Back-end
5. Databases
6. Client-side rendering vs Server-side rendering
7. DevOps/CI-CD 
8. Staging environment, Production Environment
9. App-store deployment (how do app-store apps push their updates?)
10. Website deployment (how do websites push their updates)

## Step 2: Application of Understanding

### Teardowns and Analysis

> The name of the game here is ************************************************************product, technical, and business teardowns************************************************************
> 

To apply your knowledge - one helpful way (there are others, of course) is to perform teardowns and analysis of existing products. Analyse and reverse-engineer the products, to step into the shoes and minds of the actual companies and product managers.

For business teardowns - the business model canvas and other useful frameworks will be sufficient

For product teardowns - here are some resources and examples:

### Join Communities

Also - join product communities to chat with like-minded people and get advice! Lots of product communities online out there!

## Step 3: Build Your Portfolio

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ What you want to try to do here - is to give yourself the experience of product management and development - where possible. Naturally there is much you cannot replicate compared to an actual working environment with proper teams.

</aside>

Best way to solidify and demonstrate your product management skills - actually ideate, design, build, and even roll out products - ****************************and compile your work for public viewing for your employers.****************************

### **Ideate - come up with ideas!**

1. ****************Amazonâ€™s PR/FAQ**************** method of product ideation is pretty effective and demanding - [https://productstrategy.co/working-backwards-the-amazon-prfaq-for-product-innovation/](https://productstrategy.co/working-backwards-the-amazon-prfaq-for-product-innovation/)

### **Design - learn how to come up with basic designs and wireframes for your idea**

1. Learning how to use Figma will never hurt!

### **Build - figma prototypes are great, but actual products are even better!**

1. Use no-code platforms like [Bubble.io](http://Bubble.io) to build out mvp/prototypes that actual work with a functioning front-end, back-end, and database - that you can get actual users to try out!

### **Roll-out - importantly - getting feedback from actual users is always good**

1. Starting small? share with your families and friends, or any mentors you might have
2. Wanting to really try something interesting? Maybe try sharing it on sites like producthunt, or on twitter even!

Last but not least - where to display

- can be your own website
- or your own github repo
- or article repositories like medium
- or twitter even
